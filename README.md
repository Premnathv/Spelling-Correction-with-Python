# Spelling-Correction-with-Python
Correcting spelling mistakes is an integral part of writing in the modern world, whether it is part of texting a phone, sending an email, writing large documents or searching for information on the web.  Modern spelling correctors aren’t perfect (indeed, automatic error correction is a popular source of fun on the web), but they’re ubiquitous in just about all software that relies on keyboard input.  Spelling correction is often viewed from two angles. Non-word spell check is the detection and correction of spelling mistakes that result in non-words. In contrast, real word spell checking involves detecting and correcting misspellings even if they accidentally result in a real English word (real word errors).
